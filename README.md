Approach: Built a React (Vite) single-page editor and live resume preview. Data is stored in a single JSON schema and autosaved to localStorage for persistence. The UI is divided into Editor and Preview to maximize WYSIWYG experience. The system is designed to connect to backend APIs for saving and exporting, and supports future features: verification integration, AI-generated summaries, and cross-platform data sync.
Tools: React, Vite, vanilla CSS. Future backend: Spring Boot + MySQL (APIs planned).
How this fits the system: This frontend is the primary user-facing component that enables real-time resume updates based on activities from other platforms (hackathons, courses). It provides the data model and UI hooks for backend integration, AI summary generation, and verification modules.
